# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-2D-CNN
In this project, we demonstrate a method for Human Activity Recognition (HAR), using the end-to-end approach in a neural network. The 2D convolutional layer deep neural network architecture we used automatically extracts activity features and classifies them using only a few model parameters. The model performance was evaluated on open source WISDM datasets to classify the human Activity. Also, we used different optimizers in the network architecture for better results. 

INSTRUCTIONS TO USE THE CODE:
1) Download all the files in the git repository and unzip the "WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw" folder into a file by the same name.
2) The prefered platform for executing this code is Google Collab.
3) Upload the "APM598_FinalProject_HARusingCNN" file to Google Collab platform.
4) Next, upload the text file "WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw.txt" to the content folder in the Google Collab. (Please refer to the Youtube Video for more details)
5) Once this is setup, please run the code to observe the results.
